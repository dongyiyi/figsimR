Title: Simulating Fig Wasp Community Assembly
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Yiyi Dong
Maintainer: Yiyi Dong <dongyiyi09@hotmail.com>
Description: Simulates the assembly and structure of fig wasp communities 
    within fig fruits (Ficus racemosa), capturing ecological processes such as 
    entry order, parasitism, spatial oviposition constraints, resource limitation, 
    and fruit abortion. Designed for ecological modeling and hypothesis testing 
    using empirical parameters. Current version 0.2.0 is integrated with the "sink strength" theory.

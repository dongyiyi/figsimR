\title{Bootstrap Resampling of Observed Community Metrics}
\usage{
resample_observed_all_metrics(
  observed_df,
  wasp_cols,
  n_draws = 500,
  sample_n = 200,
  seed = NULL,
  calc_func = calc_all_metrics
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_df}{A data.frame containing fig-level community observations,
with one row per fig and one column per wasp species (typically emergence counts).}

\item{wasp_cols}{A character vector indicating which columns in \code{observed_df}
correspond to wasp species. These columns will be used to compute metrics.}

\item{n_draws}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replicates to generate. Default = 500.}

\item{sample_n}{Integer. Number of figs to sample per bootstrap iteration. Default = 200.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. If provided, sets the random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{calc_func}{A function to calculate community metrics. Must accept a data.frame
of species abundance (rows = figs, columns = species). Default = \code{\link{calc_all_metrics}}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing \code{n_draws} rows, each row representing a bootstrap
  replicate. Each row includes all metrics returned by \code{calc_func}, along with
  a column \code{source = "Observed"}.
}
\description{
This function resamples the observed fig wasp community dataset multiple times
to estimate the distribution of community metrics, such as diversity and network structure.
It is typically used to compare observed patterns against simulated outputs.
}
\details{
In each iteration, the function randomly samples \code{sample_n} rows (with replacement)
from the observed dataset, calculates community metrics using \code{calc_func},
and stores the results.

This resampling approach estimates the empirical distribution of community metrics
under the observed data, providing a null reference for comparison with simulation outputs.

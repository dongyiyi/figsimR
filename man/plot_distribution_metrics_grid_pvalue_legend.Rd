\title{Plot Metric Distributions with KS Test and Shared Legend}
\usage{
plot_distribution_metrics_grid_pvalue_legend(
  obs_metrics,
  sim_metrics,
  ncol = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_metrics}{A data frame containing observed metric values. Only numeric columns will be used.}

\item{sim_metrics}{A data frame containing simulated metric values. Must have the same structure as \code{obs_metrics}.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the output plot grid. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A grid of density plots (one per metric) comparing observed and simulated distributions, with
a shared legend on top. Each plot shows a KS test p-value between observed and simulated distributions.
}
\description{
This function compares the distributions of community-level metrics between observed and simulated datasets
using kernel density plots. Each metric is tested with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, and the resulting p-value
is displayed as the title of each plot. A shared legend is displayed above all subplots.
}
\details{
This function helps evaluate model performance by comparing the distribution of each community-level
metric (e.g., alpha diversity, richness, network structure) between observed and simulated datasets.
A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is performed for each metric, and its p-value is shown in the plot title.

The shared legend distinguishes between observed and simulated data and is extracted from the first plot.
All plots are styled consistently for integration into figure panels or reports.

\title{Plot Metric Distributions with Wilcoxon Test Significance}
\usage{
plot_distribution_metrics_grid_pvalue(obs_metrics, sim_metrics, ncol = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs_metrics}{A data frame of observed community metrics (e.g., alpha, beta, network structure).
Must include only numeric columns to be tested and plotted.}

\item{sim_metrics}{A data frame of simulated metrics from the same set of metrics as \code{obs_metrics}.
The columns should have the same names and types as in \code{obs_metrics}.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns to arrange plots in the output grid. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A grid of \code{ggplot2} density plots, one for each shared numeric metric.
  Each plot includes a Wilcoxon rank-sum test result between the observed and simulated values,
  reported as p-value and a significance label (*** < 0.001, ** < 0.01, * < 0.05, ns otherwise).
}
\description{
This function compares the distributions of community-level metrics between observed
and simulated datasets. It visualizes the density plots for each numeric metric side-by-side
and annotates each with the Wilcoxon test p-value and corresponding significance level.
}
\details{
This function is useful for model evaluation, allowing users to assess whether the distributions
of key diversity or network metrics produced by a simulation (e.g., FIM) differ significantly
from those observed in empirical data. It uses nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for comparison.

Metrics that are not numeric or are not shared between \code{obs_metrics} and \code{sim_metrics}
will be ignored.

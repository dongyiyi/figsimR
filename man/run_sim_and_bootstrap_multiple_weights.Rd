\title{Run Simulations and Bootstrap Community Metrics Across Interaction Weights}
\usage{
run_sim_and_bootstrap_multiple_weights(
  weights = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9),
  n_reps = 500,
  sample_size = 200,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{A numeric vector of \code{interaction_weight} values to evaluate. Default: c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9).}

\item{n_reps}{Number of bootstrap replicates per weight. Default: 500.}

\item{sample_size}{Number of figs to sample per replicate. Default: 200.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default: 42.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames. Each element corresponds to one interaction weight and contains
bootstrap resampled community metrics computed from the simulation.
}
\description{
This function automates the process of running the fig wasp community simulator
with multiple values of \code{interaction_weight}, and performs bootstrap resampling
on each result to assess variability in community metrics.
}
\details{
This function requires that global objects such as \code{lhs_best_param_list},
\code{observed_interaction_matrix}, and \code{simulate_figwasp_community()}
be pre-defined. The function uses \code{resample_metrics_from_simulation()} internally
to compute alpha diversity or other community structure metrics for each simulation run.
